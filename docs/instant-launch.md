# The window never waits

## Requirement

The app opens immediately. Nothing that loads links may run in front of the
window: not the local file, not a `% include:` url, not the collection api.
A summon is a keystroke, so it must feel like one.

Links are always a redraw behind, never a delay in front.

## Rules

- Every path that shows the window calls `show_window()`. It starts a reload and
  does not await it.
- `start_refresh()` is the only collection call a show path makes. Its name says
  what it does: it starts the work and returns.
- `load_collection()` reads the local source alone. `% include:` urls belong to
  `refresh_collection()`, which runs after the window is up.
- Startup awaits `load_collection()` once, because `% design:` decides which
  design to load. That is a local file read.
- A pulled url gets 5 seconds and is then abandoned. The window never learns
  about it; the log does.
- New links reach the window through `api_items_changed`. The design redraws
  itself, so a slow source costs a redraw, never a stalled window.

## Measurements

An include url delayed by 3 seconds, the app driven under Xvfb:

| What                                | Time    |
|-------------------------------------|---------|
| window up, showing the local links  | 569 ms  |
| summon: socket ping → input cleared | 4 ms    |
| pulled links arrive in the window   | 3597 ms |

The summon lands in 4 ms while a 3-second pull is in flight. That is the number
to keep.

## Measuring again

Start the app under `Xvfb` with `--remote-debugging-port=9222`, point an
`% include:` line at a url that answers slowly, then drive it over the devtools
protocol: write a marker into the search input, ping `navplace.sock` the way
`launcher.js` does, and time how long the marker takes to clear.
